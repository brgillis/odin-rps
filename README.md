Description
-----------

This is a learning project developed as part of The Odin Project (www.theodinproject.com). The goal of this project is to use JavaScript to program a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in the browser. The game can be played by loading the page (linked above) and clicking one of the three buttons to choose a play. The game ends when either the human or computer reaches 5 points, after which a button appears to allow the game to be reset.
